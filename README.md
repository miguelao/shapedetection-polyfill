# ShapeDetection polyfill

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/miguelao/shapedetection-polyfill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/miguelao/shapedetection-polyfill)

The [WICG Shape Detection](https://wicg.github.io/shape-detection-api) specification provides access from the Web to the native platform's capabilities to detect shapes in moving or still images. The shapes can be e.g. 1- or 2-D barcodes, text or human faces.

This polyfill bridges the gaps among browsers and platforms since not all provide the same capabilities.


# Demo
